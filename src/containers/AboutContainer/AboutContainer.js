    <p>My name is <strong>Thomas Mion</strong>.</p>
    <p>
        As a <strong>self-taught developer</strong>, I worked on various personal projects as a teenager before I earned a certification in web development practices in 2017 and started making use of <strong>my passion in real life applications</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        I work as a fulltime developer since then, learning new practices and meeting people along the way. I'm fond of <strong>Clean Code</strong>, <strong>refactoring</strong>, and <strong>functional programming</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is my belief that, as a programmer, <strong>you need to do more than just typing on a keyboard</strong> to do a good job: you need to talk to people, to think about the bottom line, and to remember that at the end of the day, your users depends on you!
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>I want to work with people who share this feeling</strong>, and I believe this is the best way to make software.

    <p>This portfolio you're currently reading is not a <em>state of the art</em> website: while it uses ReactJS and modern JavaScript, I wanted to keep things simple instead of showing off every big library out there. Feel free to take a look at the code on <a href="https://github.com/RaspberryEuphoria/portfolio">my GitHub</a>!</p>
